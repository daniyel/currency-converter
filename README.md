This is an example currency converter.

## How it works

Choose amount we want to convert, initial and end currency. Press convert. Below we can see history of conversions.

## Prerequisites

Replace `REACT_APP_OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_APP_ID` in `.env` with your `app_id`, that you get by registering at [https://openexchangerates.org/signup](https://openexchangerates.org/signup).

Notice: Free version is limited for converting values between `USD` and other currencies. For conversion between other currencies, we need either `The Developer`, `The Enterprise` or `The Unlimited` plan.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Production

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
